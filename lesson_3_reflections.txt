When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaboration across geographically different teams is required.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
We might want to remain undisturbed while developing our feature and then add new features at will.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork Used when u want to change someone else's repo contents, but do not have permission to chnge it.
Clones when u want to make changes locally, esp when the changes are large or have to be run, eg., code changes.
branch when u add a new or experimental feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
Difficult to visualize changes
easier without hassles of learning to use git or github.



When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When the changes are experimental. This ensures that my changes are correct befor merging onto the master branch.
When I change and commit in the master I have to be to totally confident that that doesn't break others' work, but its less work
than having to make the changes in a separate branch and then merge onto master.
