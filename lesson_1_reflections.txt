How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easy and visual, and showed only what was required.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

   It can help figuring out what code was written in what version.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    We decide when something becomes a new version, we have more control over what others can see.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because the commit is manual and if there are many files, it becomes tedious
    to check in everything separately one by one.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because I know which version caused the failure, and revert to a version before that.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version contrl
